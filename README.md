# Hand Gesture Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks

This project aims to recognize hand gestures using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The dataset used in this project consists of hand gesture images from the [Hagrid dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ruturajkanakdande/hagrid-classification-512p) on Kaggle. The gestures include "call", "dislike", "fist", "four", "like", "mute", "ok", "one", "palm", "peace", "peace_inverted", "rock", "stop", "stop_inverted", "three", "three2", "two_up", and "two_up_inverted".

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Python (>=3.6)
- pip (Python package installer)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running notebooks)

### Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash

```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd hand-gesture-recognition
```

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Hand_Gesture_Recognition.ipynb` for an overview of the project and to run the code interactively.


```bash
python hand_gesture_recognition.py
```

### Results

The trained CNN model achieved a test accuracy of approximately 25.22% on the hand gesture recognition task. A confusion matrix is provided in the notebook for a detailed analysis of the model's performance.
